        <p class="header-des">Under Article 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU), citizens have the right to move freely within the EU, however, this does not give airlines or airports the right to infringe on our consumer rights.  It is not always possible to reach your destination by car or bus and often the most convenient method of reaching your destination is by using commercial airlines.</p>
